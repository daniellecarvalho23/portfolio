            <div class="problem">
            <h1>Opportunity</h1>
            <p> We are targeting the EduTech, JobTech and
                HRTech sectors, targeting job applicants who
                often struggle with engaging in conversational
                dialogue during interviews.
               </p>
               <p>
                Our aim is to empower applicants by addressing
                common challenges they face during job
                interviews and in the job search process. In our
                research, we identified four main challenges that
                applicants are currently encountering.
               </p>
               <p> Many job seekers struggle to find tailored
                interview practice materials that suit their
                specific industry, resulting in spending time on
                irrelevant subjects.
               </p>
               <p>
                Job listings for similar roles often have
                different titles and requirements, which
                makes it difficult for them to identify the best
                positions to apply for.
               </p>
               <p> Difficulty to find the right questions and study
                materials for his field.</p>
